## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS => promises with async/await, fetch API 
- IPIFY (IP Geolocation API)
- Leaflet (JS library for mobile-friendly interactive maps)

### What I learned

I started the challenge over-complicating things, then i realized all i had to do was use fetch and async/await to get the data. So i can say that i learned to keep things simple. 

### Continued development

The key is out there, naked and afraid, so it would be good to learn how to hide it. Maybe I should've deployed to heroku. Also, CSS can always be better.
